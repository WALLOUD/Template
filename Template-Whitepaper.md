Permissions in TFS 
---

Permissions determine the authorization for user actions such as workspace administration and project creation. When you create a Team Project in Team Foundation Server, TFS creates default security groups for the project regardless of your choice of process template. By default, each of these security groups has a set of permissions defined for it and this governs what members of those groups are authorized to do.

We integrate Team Foundation Server with SQL Server Reporting Services to provide project-level reports and integrate TFS with SharePoint Server to provide project portals. Because of these integration features, managing permissions in TFS is now distributed across different areas. We need one tool to manage user permissions across these areas.

Team Foundation Server communities, partners, and experts have created various tools to facilitate centralized management of security permissions.

Top 3 tools for security management
---

Below, we have summarized security-related features for the top three tools available for managing Team Foundation Server Permissions.

While these tools provide many great features to facilitate permissions management, there are still some missing features. There is an increasing need for TFS to go beyond ALM. Customers often demand new features, driven by the policies and regulations applicable to their business. One such need customers repeatedly face is to create a comprehensive report, on permissions that a TFS user or security group has in terms of known and accessible security namespaces.

Security namespace
---

A security namespace is a container or grouping of security privileges within Team Foundation Server. You manage security assignments and permissions within the scope of a specific namespace. A namespace may be different based on the level or subsystem you are querying. For example, Server level namespaces are different from Team Project Collection level namespaces.

A namespace has security permissions or actions, referring to the action that you can control by allowing or disallowing any members or objects from performing the action. The permissions are generally specific to the namespace, for example on the Web Access Server namespace there is a permission called “Use Full Web Access features” whereas on the Team Project Collection VersionControlItems namespace there is a permission for “Read” or “Check in”.

Using the namespace with the list of permissions, you build up access control lists (ACLs) either by inheriting or explicitly allowing or denying the member or object from performing the action.

![](media/image2.png)

*Figure 1 – High level grouping of namespaces, actions, and member assignments*

There are two simple ways of interacting with the namespaces of a Team Foundation Server instance. You can use either the
[TFSSecurity.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252504.aspx) command line utility, or the Team Foundation Server’s **Object Model API**s.

### Interacting with security namespaces using TFSSecurity tool

Microsoft ships the **TFSSecurity.exe** command line tool with both Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio. You can find it in the following default locations for Team Foundation Server 2013 and VS 2013:

```
Team Foundation Server application tier: %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 12.0\Tools
Visual Studio: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE
```

You can use the **TFSSecurity.exe** utility to list security namespaces, list the actions, show access control lists and do permission assignments.

The tool differentiates between the Server-level and Team Project Collection-level namespaces by either accepting a /server or /collection parameter. For example to list all of the Server security namespaces, execute the following command:

```
Tfssecurity.exe /a /server:http://<<tfsserver>>:8080/tfs
```

In addition, you can list all the Team Project Collection-level security namespaces by executing the following command:

```
TFSSecurity.exe /a /collection:http://<<tfsserver>>:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection
```

### Interacting with security namespaces using TFS OM

You can use The **Team Foundation Server Object Model** (TFS OM) to list the namespaces and actions as well as read the access control lists and do permission assignments. The level of namespaces retrieved depends on the connection type from which you retrieve the security proxy.

For example to get a list of namespaces from a Team Project Collection, use the **TfsTeamProjectCollection** object to establish a connection.

```
var collection = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(
                         new Uri("http://<<server>>:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection"));
collection.Authenticate();
var security   = collection.GetService<ISecurityService>();
var namespaces = security.GetSecurityNamespaces();
```
*Code 1 - Using TFS OM to query Team Project Collection-level security namespaces*

To get a list of namespaces from the Server, use the **TfsConfigurationServer** object to establish a connection.

```
var server = new TfsConfigurationServer (new Uri("http://<<server>>:8080/tfs"));
server.Authenticate();
var security   = collection.GetService<ISecurityService>();
var namespaces = security.GetSecurityNamespaces();
```
*Code 2 - Using TFS OM to query TFS server-level security namespaces*

Once you establish the connection, the convention for listing and interacting with the namespaces is the same; both use the **ISecurityService** proxy interface.

We categorize TFS Security namespaces as **Server-**level and **Team Project Collection**-level. TFS expands the namespaces with the permissions that each namespace supports.

Server-level permissions are not specific to any Team Project Collection or Team Project. TFS enables setting Permissions on a TFS deployment-wide basis and these permissions affect every Team Project and Team Project Collection in the deployment.

Peruse the
[ISecurityService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.framework.client.isecurityservice.aspx)
interface, the
[GetSecurityNamespace](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.framework.client.isecurityservice.getsecuritynamespace.aspx),
and
[TfsConfigurationServer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.client.tfsconfigurationserver.aspx)
object to establish a connection

Project Collection-level permissions are set on a Team Project Collection-wide basis. These permissions are not specific to a single Team Project; instead, they contain permissions that can affect every Team Project in the Team Project Collection.

See [ISecurityService
Interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.framework.client.isecurityservice.aspx),
[GetSecurityNamespace](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.framework.client.isecurityservice.getsecuritynamespace.aspx),
and use the
[TfsTeamProjectCollection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.client.tfsteamprojectcollection.aspx) object to establish a connection.

Extensible sample tool to help you
---
---
NOTE: Download the complete sample code from GiHub (https://github.com/ALM-Rangers/Extracting-effective-permissions-from-TFS/tree/master/Source).
 ---

### A quick tour

The purpose of the custom sample program is to provide a real-world example of how to retrieve the security namespaces. It is a good start for learning the TFS security model APIs and for developing your own auditing tool. We tested the tool on TFS 2013 Update 3 and Visual Studio Online (as of October 2014).

You can use the XML output format to generate regular snapshots for a specific account. Since we structure the output, you can use it to compare snapshots to previous versions. The source code contains an XSL transform that generates a formatted html output from the XML report. We purposely omitted some tests to keep the code as clear as possible and to focus on accessing the API.

The command line parameters are simple:

-   **--collection**=\<URL of the collection\>\
    Specify the collection URL, similar to using the tf.exe tool, for example: http://yourservername:8080/tfs/yourcollection

-   **--users**=\<username 1\> \<username 2\>\
    Username format can be “domain\\account” for TFS Server or email for VSO account

-   **--f**=\<logfile\>\
    The username is added in the name of the log: if the argument is “c:\\temp\\auditlog.txt” and username is demo\\user, the audit file output would be c:\\temp\\auditlog\_demo\_user.xml”

-   **--html**\
    In addition to the xml log, produce a user-friendly html based report.

In case of an error, the sample program returns a non-zero exit code.

The program stops if the current user does not have the administrative rights on the collection.

For each user, the program retrieves the following permissions to generate the xml-output report file:

  * Project
  * Version control
  * Build
  * Warehouse
  * WorkItems
  * Areas
  * Iterations
  * Workspace

You can extract effective permissions for a user across all Team Projects within a Team Project Collection by executing the following command:

```
PermissionsExtractionTool.exe 
      -u "Windows Live ID\demo@hotmail.com" 
      --collection https:// demo.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection 
      -f c:\temp\demo.xml
```

The sample program generates a comprehensive XML based report as shown below:

![](media/image3.png)

*Figure 2 - Sample Report*

*Figure 3 - Sample report mapping to web admin view*

### Generate a HTML Report from the XML Output

You can use any XSLT tool for this task. If you only have Visual Studio
2013, you can perform these four steps:

1.  Open the xml file in Visual Studio 2013
2.  Locate the XSLT document in the XslTemplates directory of the sample solution.
3.  Select the xml file in Visual Studio 2013, in the XML Menu click on “Start XSL without Debugging.”
4.  Select the xml transform.

The following extract shows a typical report generated by the sample tool and transformed using the XSLT document.
